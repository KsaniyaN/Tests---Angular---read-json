Task:
Please call this API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and show all name, username and lat in Angular 7.

It took me a few hours to get a basic understanding of current Angular main features,
and finally understand the "Using Angular HttpClient" tutorial.

Thanks for the task!
It was my pleasure to learn so much and to get the right result.
